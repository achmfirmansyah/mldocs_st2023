# Introduction

In 2023, Statistics Indonesia utilize remote sensing to build Agricultural Potential Map as one of the output of Agricultural Census 2023. 
Agricultural Potential Map will classify all Indonesia area to some land cover class, such as rice fields, fields, oil palm plantation, tea plantation and others land covers class. It will show the agricultural potential area in Indonesia and being an area sampling frames.

This book presents the guidance and workflow of <b>Agricultural Potential Map</b>. The process utilize several Machine Learning algorithms. 
In this Jupyter Book will show the workflow and syntax used in this process.


The workflow consist of 4 main steps, as follow:
- Preparing Sample Area for Data Collection
- Satellite imagery acquisition [<i>underconstructed</i>]
- Data modeling and Classification process [<i>underconstructed</i>]
- Post processing [<i>underconstructed</i>]

<i> Note: </i> <br> This workbook will be updated frequently as soon as the process have been conducted. Please check this workbook frequently.
