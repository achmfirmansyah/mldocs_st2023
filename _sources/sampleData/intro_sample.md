# Preparing Sample Area for Data Collection

The first procedure in the workflow is preparing sample locations for data collection. 
In this step, we will utilize several data, i.e.:
- Satellite imagery (SPOT 6/7) with acquisition date arrange from Jan 2019- June 2020. 
The data have been acquired through collaboration with 
National Research and Innovation Agency / BRIN, previously known as National Institute of Aeronautics and Space / LAPAN. Please read this <a href='https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/spot-6-7'>link</a> for documentations.
- Land cover classification; produced from Mapping Development Division, Directorate of Census and Survey Development, Statistics Indonesia. This map have produced in 2021. the satellite imagery for preparing sample area.

The workflow of this procedure can be shown as follows:

For each step in this procedure, we will provide detail explanation.
The output of this procedure are polygons that marked as sample area. Those locations will be used as destined location for in situ data collection via geotagging.
